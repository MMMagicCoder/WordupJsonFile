    "Usage": "The word 'application' is often used when talking about computer and phone programs. These are also called 'apps'. You might hear someone say, \"I downloaded a new application on my phone.\" This means they got a new program to use on their phone, like a game or a tool to help them organize their day. 'Application' can also mean a form you fill out when you want to apply for something, like a job or a school. It's important to pay attention to the context of how the word is used to understand its meaning.",

    "Comparisons": [
        "Appeal|An appeal is a request for reconsideration of a decision that has already been made by a higher authority.\n\nIt is usually made when the decision is believed to be incorrect, unjust, or unfair. An appeal is typically made to a court, a professional organization or a government agency.\n\nFor example, if someone has been convicted of a crime and believes that the judgement was incorrect, they can file an appeal to a higher court.\n\nThe main difference between an appeal and an application is that an appeal is made after a decision has been made while an application is made before a decision has been made.",
        "Claim|Claim means to declare something to be true or to demand compensation for something, like an insurance claim or a legal claim.\n\nIt is often used when someone is stating that they have a right to something, such as claiming a prize or claiming ownership of a property.\n\nApplication is used when requesting something, while claim is used when asserting a right to something.",
        "Entreaty|Entreaty means a humble request or plea, often made with urgency or desperation. It's used to describe a request made to someone, usually a person of authority or influence, in the hopes of receiving their help or assistance.\n\nApplication is a formal request for something, while entreaty is a more emotional and urgent request for help or assistance.",
        "Petition|A petition is a document that is used to ask for a change in something that already exists, or to make a request to a government, company, organization or other entity.\n\nFor example, if you want to change a law or regulation, you would create a petition asking the government to change it.\n\nSo, while both words involve making a request, applications are used to ask for something you want, while petitions are used to ask for change.",
        "Proposal|A proposal is a written plan or suggestion that is presented to a person or a group. It outlines an idea or a project and explains how it will be executed.\n\nProposals are usually used to request funding, permission to do something, or to persuade someone to take action.\n\nIn summary, applications are used to apply for something, while proposals are used to suggest ideas or projects. Applications are typically used in the context of employment or education, whereas proposals can be used in a variety of contexts, such as business, science, and politics.",
        "Request|An application is a formal document or process, usually involving filling out a form, that you submit to request something or to be considered for something, such as a job, school admission, or a loan.\n\nA request is simply asking for something, usually informally, but it can also be done formally. For instance, you can request a promotion at work, request someone to complete a task for you, or request permission from your parents to go out with friends.\n\nOverall, applications imply a more formalized process and are usually associated with more significant or consequential things, while requests are generally informal and more common in everyday life.",
        "Submission|Submission is the act of handing something over for consideration, approval, or decision.\n\nApplication is used when you are asking for something, and submission is used when you are giving something for someone else to review or decide on.",
        "Suit|Suit usually refers to a set of clothes that match, usually a jacket and pants made from the same fabric. It is worn for formal or professional occasions, such as weddings or interviews.\n\nApplication is applicable when you are requesting or proposing something, while suit is applicable when you are dressing up formally."
